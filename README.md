# 🌾 GramPulse: Village Sustainability Index Tracker

GramPulse is a civic-tech platform designed to **empower rural citizens**, **streamline grievance redressal**, and **generate real-time sustainability metrics** for villages. It transforms fragmented governance into a **transparent, accountable system**—bridging the gap between **citizens, agencies, and policymakers**.

---

## 🌟 Overview

In many rural regions, governance is reactive instead of proactive. Citizens raise issues—**water shortages, broken roads, sanitation failures**—but there is often:

- No clear **timeline** for resolution  
- No **accountability** across departments  
- No **standard metric** to measure village well-being  

**GramPulse** solves this by introducing a **Village Sustainability Index (VSI)**:  
a dynamic score that reflects the **health, responsiveness, and resilience** of a village.

---

## 🚨 The Problem

- Grievances are raised through scattered channels (paper, calls, local visits).  
- There is **no unified grievance pipeline** with tracking or escalation.  
- Citizens rarely know:
  - *Who is responsible?*  
  - *What is the status?*  
  - *Why is it delayed?*  
- Agencies lack real-time dashboards to prioritize interventions.  
- Policymakers don't have **live, ground-level data** for policy decisions.

This leads to:

- **Unresolved issues**
- **Eroded public trust**
- **Purely reactive governance**

---

## ✅ The Solution: Village Sustainability Index (VSI)

GramPulse introduces a **Village Sustainability Index (VSI)** that updates in real time based on:

- Grievance volume and resolution rate  
- Time taken vs SLA (Service Level Agreement)  
- Infrastructure status and recurring issues  
- Citizen feedback and satisfaction

### How It Works

1. **Citizens** submit grievances via a simple web interface.
2. **Agencies** receive assigned issues with clear SLA timelines.
3. Each state change (created, in-progress, resolved, overdue) **updates the VSI**.
4. **All records** are:
   - Traceable  
   - Auditable  
   - Publicly visible in a dashboard  

This creates a feedback loop where:

- **Transparency → drives accountability**  
- **Data → drives policy & funding decisions**

## 🔗 Web3 Relevance

GramPulse leverages **Web3** to strengthen **trust and auditability**:

- Each grievance (or batch of grievances) generates a **content hash** stored on-chain.
- This ensures:
  - Records can’t be silently modified or deleted.
  - Citizens and auditors can independently verify grievance history.
- Future roadmap includes:
  - **DAO-based funding** for critical village projects  
  - **Citizen voting** to prioritize issues and budget allocation  

**Innovation Domains**

- 🏛️ **DeGov** (Decentralized Governance)  
- 🌱 **Public Good Funding**  
- 🗳️ **Political Tech**  
- 🤖 **Crypto-AI** *(planned)*
